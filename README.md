## 📘 Learning Journal

> "Learning to use Splunk’s search queries to identify brute-force login attempts was eye-opening. Seeing how events can be filtered and visualised made threat detection feel real and actionable."

> "Setting up and sniffing DNS traffic in Wireshark reminded me how exposed basic protocols are. Encryption matters more than ever."
